Knockout Extensions
===================

This project contains a number of useful extensions and databindings for the [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com) javascript library.

To view demos of these extensions check out the JS Fiddles below, or download the latest version of the source and run the included demo project.

## Knockout Data Bindings ##

### DataTables Binding
Supports the integration of [DataTables](http://datatables.net) with [KnockoutJs](http://knockoutjs.com).  It 
supports row by row and cell by cell binding of a table to a knockout observable object array, and has 
basic support for AJAX based data sources.

**Please note, this binding currently does not work with version 1.9.1 and above of DataTables.  See this [link](https://github.com/CogShift/Knockout.Extensions/issues/9) for more details.**


Check out the demo project or the samples below for usage examples.  Documentation of this binding is still to come...

#### jsFiddle Samples
(There are currently issues viewing these fiddles in IE9 due to the scripts being blocked by the browser)

- [Sample 2](http://jsfiddle.net/ducka/haq2y/)

### Check Box List and Radio Button List Binding
This binding enhances the humble checkbox and radio button elements so they work just like a drop down and and list box elements.

JS Fiddles comming soon...
